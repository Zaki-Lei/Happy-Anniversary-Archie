              <p>Happy 2nd anniversary, my love!♡⁠(⁠>⁠ ⁠ਊ⁠ ⁠<⁠)⁠♡</p>
              <p>It’s been two years of countless ups and downs, laughter, and even arguments (pati tampuhan hehe) but through it all, we stayed together and held on to each other. I’m truly glad that it’s you I get to share this journey with, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us.</p>
              <p>And I just want to say thank you for everything, Archie. You’ve been my strength whenever I felt weak or having self doubts, and you always show how much you care, even in the little things. I love your smile and how your beautiful eyes seem to smile too whenever you’re happy. Your gentle touch, your soft lips, and your kindness make me fall for you even more every day.</p>
              <p>We still have a long way to go, but I’m so grateful and happy that you’re here with me, by my side. To many more anniversaries together. I love you so much, Archaea.</p>
